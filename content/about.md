A senior technical engineer with over 12 years experience working across a variety of teams within a large organization.  In my career, I have gravitated towards solving complex problems that have wide impacts across the organization.

I have a strong passion for embracing DevOps practices, and using data driven insights to improve how developers deliver code to production.  

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my amazing wife and two awesome boys.  I like to keep busy with a variety of different hobbies such as woodworking, brewing, and 3D printing.
